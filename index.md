This blog is a blog made for study and the record here is intended to improve professionalism. Three years have passed since I became a web developer, but there are many drawbacks. Through this blog, I will compensate for the shortfall. If possible, the content to be posted on the blog is written in English.

And I may have made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday I am still mine. Today, I am a person who has my own faults and mistakes. I may be a bit wise tomorrow, but that will be me too. These mistakes and errors are mine, making the brightest star in the constellation of my life.
